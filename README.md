# Movie_recommendation_system

Everyone loves movies irrespective of age, gender, race, color, or geographical location. We all in a way are connected to each other via this amazing medium. Yet what most interesting is the fact that how unique our choices and combinations are in terms of movie preferences. Some people like genre-specific movies be it a thriller, romance, or sci-fi, while others focus on lead actors and directors. When we take all that into account, it's astoundingly difficult to generalize a movie and say that everyone would like it. But with all that said, it is still seen that similar movies are liked by a specific part of the society.
 
For this I have built a Movie-Recommendation System.In this implementation, when the user searches for a movie I will recommend the top 10 similar movies using our movie recommendation system. I have used an item-based collaborative filtering algorithm for this purpose. 

The following dataset has been used for this project - https://www.kaggle.com/shubhammehta21/movie-lens-small-latest-dataset
